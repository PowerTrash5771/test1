## Chapter 1 <a name="chapter1"></a>
One time a magical dog fell in a volcano but somehow flew out in time and then the volcano erupted, the dog died and was magically put back to life, he was later named "Idiot". He helped homeless people stuck in a volcano get out and tortured people with diabetes. One day a magical ugly uncle tried to kill the dog, but it became too powerful. On February 20, 20 A.D. the magical king died because the dog killed the magical king. The dog later died in a tornado while fighting a second magical king. The dog was magically put back to life again and tried fighting the magical king, but died in a tornado. Then a dog ghost showed up and killed the magical king, the dog was magically brought back to life again. As of now on December 32, 2020 11:60 PM the dog weighs 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 pounds, the dog is now the size of earth. The dog lives both inside and outside of the atmosphere. Someone on Facebook told me that the dog died 420 years ago, so I guess the dog is real and that Facebook message is proof. 428 years ago, people had to go to space and aerate.

## Chapter 2 <a name="chapter2"></a>
The magical dog has been revived. It went to a gym and lost weight. Now some hairy butthole homeless guy owns this historic piece of crapping machine. The hairy Butthole Homeless Guy started "playing" with the dog. The name he gave the dog was the name the dog has had for billions of years, it was "Crapping Machine", Crapping Machine loved that name, but he did not like having $1 dog toys thrown at him, so he killed The Hairy Butthole Homeless Guy. The dog went back to the first place where somebody loved him, which was inside of a volcano. He loved the volcano, it was like a nice, warm bath.
